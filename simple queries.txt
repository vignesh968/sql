1.Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.


SELECT CASE 
    WHEN a+b<=c OR b+c<=a OR a+c<=b THEN 'Not A Triangle' 
    WHEN a=b AND b=c AND c=a THEN 'Equilateral' 
    WHEN a!=b AND b!=c AND c!=a THEN 'Scalene'
    ELSE 'Isosceles' 
    END 
FROM triangles;
